Programming passionate.

I have a strong grasp on Typescript, React and Node.js. I enjoy developing web apps.

Currently working on my side project https://github.com/olek03/3d-TS-engine

My goal of this project is to create a fun minecraft-like 3d game and to broaden my understanding of 3D space. While working on this project I have understood trygonometry and vector calculations to an excellent degree.
